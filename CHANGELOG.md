## 0.5.0-alpha.11 / 27 Jun 2022
This is an alpha release, but new servers should use this version rather than an older "stable" one.

Features:
 * Update `u-wave-source-youtube`. This expects that clients use u-wave-web v2.0.0-alpha.9 or later.

Bugfixes:
 * Fix crash when a media source's `play()` hook throws. (#525)

Internal:
 * Do not rely on in-process event emitters. (#522)

## 0.5.0-alpha.10 / 23 May 2022
This is an alpha release, but new servers should use this version rather than an older "stable" one.

Features:
 * Make `artist`, `title` optional when adding playlist items (#516).
   With this change, deriving the artist and title for a search result can be deferred until it
   is actually added to a playlist. Then the search can show only original titles, which makes
   finding the correct result easier, and is required for compliance with ToS for some services.

Internal:
 * **Breaking:** üWave now requires Node.js 14.17 or above. (#513)
 * Use UUIDs for chat message IDs. (#511)

This is an alpha release, but new servers should use this version rather than an older "stable" one.

Bugfixes:
 * Fix a crash in the `/api/users` endpoint. (#490)

Internal:
 * Fetch ACL sub-roles in a single database query. Should be good for performance, but most of all
   for code quality.

This is an alpha release, but new servers should use this version rather than an older "stable" one.

   Now it's actually usable :)

 * Fix adding media to the start of a playlist. (#487)

## 0.5.0-alpha.6 / 07 Nov 2021
This is an alpha release, but new servers should use this version rather than an older "stable" one.

This is a hotfix release for problems introduced during development of `alpha.5`.

Bugfixes:
 * **Breaking:** Revert `playedAt` to a UNIX timestamp.
   This fixes an accidental breaking change. I'm sorry if you updated your code already while tracking
   the development branch these past months :(
 * Make related playlists opt-in in search results. There is a serious performance problem in that
   feature, so it is available behind a query parameter for diagnostic purposes.
 * Fix registrations getting rejected when ReCaptcha is disabled.
 * Fix favouriting tracks.
